# Webpage Components
Libraries​:

● API calls using AJAX

# APIs:
● Yelp -- https://www.yelp.com/dataset○https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main & https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
Yelp Fusion
We used this API to pull details from Yelp’s database for two searches: Restaurants & Activities. 
We created selector fields for type and zip code for each to return appropriate results.
(AJAX Used to pull data) 

● Mapbox -- https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/
Map Box
We used this API to show where the results pulled from Yelp are located. The user can quickly see where the various results are based on the interactive map. 
(AJAX Used to pull data)

# New Technology
Vanilla Javascript Plug In: X-Ray.js
This was used on our sign-in homepage form.
Allows to show/hide password strings in your password field when needed.

# Repeating Elements
Yelp API Displays
Using for loops, we generated repeating elements for activities and restaurants:
Image
Business Name
Phone Number
Rating
Link to Reviews on Yelp

# Design Layout
CSS
Bootstrap:
Cards
Modals
Columns/Rows
Buttons
Nav Bar

# Validation Specs

Avoided alerts by using Modals and “Required”  for Sign In and Search functions
